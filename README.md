# MOONSAMA CARNAGE DATA by andr00sama

# I'm n00b be nice plz.

# run.py
# If you run this file and have the other files saved in the same directory, it will output the following information for every Carnage from week 48 to 55:
#
# Week Number: 55
# Total Players: 1020
# Moonsamas: 256
# Exosamas: 519
# Gromlins/VIPS: 245

# input.py
# I saved all of the json urls from mcapi.moonsama.com to two arrays, one containing the full results and the second containing the value of each gganbu share for each game.

# functions.py
# I like to put as many functions as I can in a separate file so that the run file is as clean and easy to understand as possible.
