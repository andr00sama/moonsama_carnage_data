  If you run this file and have the other files saved in the same directory, it will output the following information for every Carnage from week 48 to 55:
  <br>
  Week Number: 55
  <br>
  Total Players: 1020
  <br>
  Moonsamas: 256
  <br>
  Exosamas: 519
  <br>
  Gromlins/VIPS: 245

  input.py

  I saved all of the json urls from mcapi.moonsama.com to two arrays, one containing the full results and the second containing the value of each gganbu share for each game.

<h4>
  functions.py
</h4>

  I like to keep the run file as clean and easy to understand as possible, so I put most of the functions in a separate file
