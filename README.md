  Library of functions I've created to help process carnage data. Sama Counter counts the number of Moonsamas, Exosamas, and Gromlins/VIPs. Sama Lister gives a list of the players who showed up to Carnage for a given week. Attendance counter counts the number of times players have shown up for a range of carnage sessions.
